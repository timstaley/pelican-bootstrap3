# Examples in the wild

This is a non-exhaustive list of websites that use **pelican-boostrap3** as their theme. It shows the versatility of
the theme (which is one of the perks of using Bootstrap 3). If your website provides a unique take on **pelican-bootstrap3*
and you want your website to be listed here, don't hesitate to ask or make a pull-request! I reserve the right to refuse
websites if they're not unique enough for my tastes or if I find them offensive. If your website is listed here, but you
don't want it to be, let me know and I'll remove it.
